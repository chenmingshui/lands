added a choice of cross section prior for Bayesian technique,  "flat" and "correlated",  default is "correlated"

Christian Veelken spotted a bug during compilation, the code needs "#include <algorithm>" to be able to be compiled in different enviroments

revison 1.02 date 2010.06    --MC
Mainly develoment happened in the ATLAS+CMS toy combination exercise
implemented an interface for configuring AK's input format,  in UtilsROOT,  "ConfigureModel"

revison 1.10 date 2010.08.15 --MC
Added Tevatron type and Atlas type of test statistics,  also now can deal with rules of CLs and CLsb
PLR method for calculating significance is implemented 

2010.08.17
Trey Sellers pointed out that the code needs "#include <cstdio>" to be able to compiled in some platform other than lxplus.

Andre Sznajder  reports that CLs doesn't work under aUbuntu & ROOT v5.18 ,  but Bayesian_dataCard.exe works,  amazing !!


2010.01.
add 1/sqrt(r) prior for baysian, and make the gauss lagaurrete quadrature working for this prior...   the integration method should work for any arbitrary prior ...

correct a bug in the fitting function, now we allow r to be negative which makes CLsb work for downward flutuation case ... 

and for ATLAS type test statitics, when fitting,  constrain the mu hat to be <= mu 

2010.02. 
add gamma distribution for sideband measurement .   
when doing fit, need to constrain for the gamma distribution,  slightly different as gaussian/lognormal  

Feldman-Cousins for limit setting

In the input datacard,  when systematics is "trG", the errors should be (+/-) relative  fraction (was relative fraction +1 in previous versions, like lnN). 
UtilsROOT.cc was updated accordingly. 
Kappa in lognormal cann't be negative,  do a check . 
Neither Alpha or event count in control region in gamma cann't be negative,  do a check . 
Take maximum value of the correlated/anticorrelated trG uncertainties (compare their absolute values).   

Need to check that any given process has no more than one systematic error described by a gamma
distribution. This is a statistical part of uncertainties. All other errors would refer to systematic errors associated with the alpha-factor.

Now Lxplus default login OS is SLC6 
Compling lands with SLC5-cmssw-root doesn't work   -->  now move to my own desktop to compile lands
