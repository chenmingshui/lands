	First pass of optimizations - focused on Dima's use-case.
	Note that retrieval of vectors from CountingModel should be fixed
	in other places, too.

	* makefile:
	Enable -O2 optimization by default. Also enable debug infromation
	as with gcc this does not slow down the execution.
	Add options for compiling with profiling information.
	Use standard variable names for compiler, linker and flags.

	* include/CountingModel.h
	Return most vectors by const reference.
	Remove unnecessary semi-colons after inline methods.

	* src/CLsLimit.cc
	in function void Chisquare(...) store vectors from CountingModel
	into const references to avoid unnecessary creation, copying and
	destruction.

	* test/lands.cc
	Add profiling instrumentation.

	* changelog
	New file for documenting changes.
