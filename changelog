	Last pass of "return member vectors by const-ref" optimizations:
	all getters are converted now.
	See previous entry about two more steps that need to be done.

	* include/CountingModel.h
	One last missed vector.

	* include/BayesianBase.h
	* include/CLsLimit.h
	* include/SignificanceBands.h
	* src/CLsLimit.cc
	Return member vectors via const-ref.
	Remove unnecessary semi-colons after inline methods.

	Second pass of "return member vectors by const-ref" optimizations:
	now all getters in CountingModel.h and LimitBands.h are converted.

	What remains to be done:
	- convert getters in other .h files;
	- trace down code in .cc files that uses all these getters;
	- inspect / improve usage of vectors as function arguments.

	* include/CountingModel.h
	* src/CountingModel.cc
	Return vectors by const-ref in all remaining functions.

	* include/LimitBands.h
	Return vectors by const-ref in all functions.
	Remove unnecessary semi-colons after inline methods.

	* src/CLsLimit.cc
	Move one declaration into scope to allow usage of refs.

	First pass of optimizations - focused on Dima's use-case.
	Note that retrieval of vectors from CountingModel should be fixed
	in other places, too.

	* makefile:
	Enable -O2 optimization by default. Also enable debug infromation
	as with gcc this does not slow down the execution.
	Add options for compiling with profiling information.
	Use standard variable names for compiler, linker and flags.

	* include/CountingModel.h
	Return most vectors by const reference.
	Remove unnecessary semi-colons after inline methods.

	* src/CLsLimit.cc
	in function void Chisquare(...) store vectors from CountingModel
	into const references to avoid unnecessary creation, copying and
	destruction.

	* test/lands.cc
	Add profiling instrumentation.

	* changelog
	New file for documenting changes.
